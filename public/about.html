<h1>About Me</h1>
<p>I am a creative individual who finds designing stuff extremley fun and expressive.</p>

<p>I was born in Gospić, small town in Croatia and I grew up on Udbina, even smaller town next to the my birth place.</p>

<p>I finished faculty of Informatics in Varaždin and worked in school as well as IT support for global application in one pharmacheutical company.</p>

<p>Mom told me that I shouldn't post personal things on the internet, so this is all about me.</p>
